## OpengGL - Exercise 4

### Subject / Goals:

Implement shadow mapping in our framework.

### Tasks:

- Compute the Light Space Matrix; the lightbox gives the light position.
- Render to the depth buffer from the light view.
- Evaluate the shadows using the depth map shadows.
- [optional] Handle the shadow acne.

### How to Submit:

Create a **.zip** file with the source code (please include only the source files, the **src/** and **shader/** folders), and upload it to OLAT with a screenshot of the rendering window working on your computer. 

### Learning Targets:

- Understand how shadow mapping works.
- Learning to render to a buffer.
- Understand the depth buffer.

### Additional Information:

Check the theory from the lectures, the bibliography, and [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com).
